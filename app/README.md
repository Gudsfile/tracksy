# Tracksy app

Front end of Tracksy based on [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) and use [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/) as embedded database.

Run the application locally with:

```shell
cd app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Go to [`http://localhost:4321/`](http://localhost:4321/) and upload your downloaded file.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

As an Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ # public assets such as favicons, images, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ # reusable UI elements written in Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact
â”‚   â”‚         # see below for details of specific Tracksy components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ # common structure such as header and footer for multiple pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ # route-based files that generate the actual web pages
â”‚             # Tracksy currently has only one page
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components. See [below](##Components) for details of specific Tracksy components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from `tracksy/app/`, from a terminal:

## ðŸ”§ Components

### ðŸ“Š Charts Component

The `Charts` component is responsible for orchestrating and rendering visualizations in the app. It manages how different components interact with each other, such as coordinating between the `RangeSlider` and `StreamPerHour` components. Below is a mermaid diagram that illustrates how the `Charts` works (without the summarize query):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor SummaryPerYear
  actor StreamPerMonth
  actor Charts as Charts (Main Component)
  actor StreamPerHour
  actor RangeSlider

  Charts ->> SummaryPerYear: render
  Charts ->> StreamPerHour: render with default year
  Charts ->> RangeSlider: render with default year
  Charts ->> StreamPerMonth: render
  RangeSlider ->> Charts: year=2006
  Charts ->> StreamPerHour: render with year=2006
  RangeSlider ->> Charts: year=2007
  Charts ->> StreamPerHour: render with year=2007
```

This flow shows how user interaction leads to the rendering of dynamic charts based on fetched data.

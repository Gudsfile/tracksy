# Contributing to Tracksy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tracksy!

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please take a moment to read through this guide to understand our development workflow and conventions.

## Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for our commit messages. This convention helps us maintain a clear and consistent project history and could enable automated changelog generation.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature for the user
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

### Examples

```
feat(charts): add new streaming trends visualization

fix(auth): resolve Spotify authentication timeout issue

docs: update installation instructions in README

chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions
```

## Merge Strategy

We use **rebase and merge** as our preferred merge strategy. This approach helps maintain a clean, linear project history.

### Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**: Always work on a separate branch from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or fix with clear, focused commits

3. **Rebase Before Submitting**: Before creating a pull request, rebase your branch onto the latest `main`
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

4. **Submit Pull Request**: Create a PR with a clear description of your changes

5. **Address Feedback**: Make any requested changes and force-push if needed
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Merge**: Once approved, we'll use "Rebase and merge" to integrate your changes

### Important Notes

- Keep your commits focused and atomic
- Squash related commits if they represent a single logical change

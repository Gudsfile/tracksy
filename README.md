# Tracksy

üëÄ Visualize and understand how you listen to music.
- > The same old song? Late at night? Only in summer?
- Tracksy aims to help you answer these questions. It helps you see your data without us seeing your data.

ü¶Ü Powered by DuckDB WASM and Astro React.

üöß Currently only works with Spotify streaming data.

## Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ functions/
```

`app/` is the front end. It's an Astro project using DuckDB for data storage. This means that your uploaded data stays with you, client-side.
We don't want to help you understand your data without knowing your data.
For developers, take a look at [`app/README.md`](app/README.md) for more details on development.

`functions/` is the backend part for enriching your data from the provider's API. Although **the application doesn't yet use this part**, it is present because development is taking place in parallel. This part is being reworked for a more privacy-friendly solution.
For developers, take a look at [`functions/README.md`](functions/README.md) for more details on development.

## Usage

## "Roadmap"
The project is currently under development. We plan to add visualizations as well as a simplified view to make understanding streaming data as accessible as possible.
We also intend to support other data sources (Deezer, Funkwhale, etc.).
